# Face Detection Model | Roboflow & API Deployment

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Face Detection model using Roboflow. The model was trained on a labeled image dataset, deployed via Roboflow, and tested using API-based inference.

## 🧠 Model Development
- Created and trained a face detection model using Roboflow
- Configured model deployment and generated inference API
- Tested model predictions using API key and endpoint URL

## 🚀 Deployment & Testing
- Deployed the trained model using Roboflow cloud
- Performed real-time inference through API calls
- Validated model accuracy on unseen images

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Roboflow
- Computer Vision
- REST API
- Google Colab

## 📂 Files Included
- Google Colab (.ipynb)
- Sample test images
- Output screenshots

⚠️ Note: API keys are excluded for security reasons.
